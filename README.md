# Troll Generator

Troll Generator allows users to create an account and quickly generate randomized trolls.  The user can give their trolls a name and description, see what trolls they've created, delete trolls they don't want, like and view other users trolls.

## Description

Duration: 2 Weeks

It was a challenge to build a randomizer function that would generate random trolls based off 3 attributes: Element, Head, and Body.  Each attribute has 3 different options creating a total of 27 different combinations.  It was also a challenge creating all the art for this project so each piece would align and ultimately build a new troll.
